            <p>Born in Argentina in 1960, Maradona's journey in professional football began with Argentinos Juniors before moving to Boca Juniors, where his prowess caught the eye of European giants. He played for Barcelona and Napoli, where he achieved cult status, leading the Italian club to unprecedented success, including two Serie A titles and a UEFA Cup. Maradona's international career was equally illustrious, culminating in lifting the FIFA World Cup with Argentina in 1986, a tournament where his infamous "Hand of God" goal and the sublime "Goal of the Century" showcased his brilliance.</p>
